## Current Projects

### Learning of Safety-Critical Model Predictive Controllers for Autonomous Systems
**Funded by EPSRC (New Investigator Award)** | [Project Details](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FX015459%2F1)

Mobile robots and autonomous vehicles rely heavily on motion control techniques. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful framework for this, offering strong safety assurances but requiring significant expert knowledge to implement. Conversely, AI techniques like reinforcement learning can learn control policies automatically but lack safety guarantees.

This project aims to bridge this gap by developing AI methods to **automatically design MPC for safe motion control** of autonomous systems.
*   **Goal:** Enable rapid design of safe controllers, reducing development time/cost while improving reliability.
*   **Approach:** Differentiating MPC controllers to train them within reinforcement learning frameworks.
*   **Applications:** Autonomous vehicles and stability-assisted motorcycles (in partnership with Dynamotion and the University of Padova).

### Holly Health: AI-Driven Chronic Condition Management
**Funded by Innovate UK**

In partnership with [Holly Health](https://hollyhealth.io/) and Modality Partnership, we are developing the **Prevent App**, an innovative digital health tool to help individuals manage multiple chronic conditions.
*   **Technology:** A Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) machine learning system that delivers personalized coaching interventions.
*   **Impact:** Targeting the 30% of UK adults with multimorbidity to improve health outcomes and reduce NHS burden.
*   **Role:** Combining behavioural science with machine learning to tailor support for evolving patient needs.

## Research Themes

### Optimal control of constrained and uncertain systems
Many important control problems in industry involve optimising a performance measure while satisfying safety-critical constraints. Real-world systems must handle uncertainty. We develop advanced modelling and control techniques to improve energy economy and safety in automotive and renewable sectors.

### Model predictive control and its applications
MPC predicts and optimises future system states. To handle uncertainty without computationally prohibitive complexity, we have developed approaches that consider **sets** of predicted states. This leads to robust controllers with applications in:
*   **Driver Assistance:** Reducing energy usage by predicting traffic conditions.
*   **Vehicle Systems:** Intelligent air conditioning scheduling.
*   **Motorcycles:** Gyroscopic stabilisation systems for enhanced stability.
