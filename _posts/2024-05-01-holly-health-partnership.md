Researchers from CLiMB and Wolfson School of Engineering are set to develop an innovative digital health app to help individuals with multiple chronic conditions manage their health care.

We will work in partnership with healthy habit coaching app, [Holly Health](https://hollyhealth.io/), and awarding-winning health care and community services provider, Modality Partnership, to launch the **Prevent App**.

The pioneering project has successfully secured **£447,000 from Innovate UK**, which will enable us to develop a cutting-edge Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) machine learning system that effectively manages chronic conditions.

> "It’s great to be part of a project like this that takes a data-driven approach to health and wellbeing. Holly Health’s Prevent app is truly innovative and shows great promise to both improve outcomes for individual patients using personalisation and have a significant positive impact on a population scale." — **Dr James Fleming**

With 30% of UK adults living with two or more chronic conditions, also known as multimorbidity, the technology has the potential to improve the health outcomes for hundreds and thousands of people.

The new app will enhance the Holly Health Personalised Digital Coaching Service, which has already shown a 33% reduction in patients needing GP support. It will combine machine learning with adaptive behaviour change techniques to deliver timely and effective coaching interventions to individuals.
